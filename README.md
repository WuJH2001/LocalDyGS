This repository is the official implementation of **"LocalDyGS : Multi-view Global Dynamic Scene Modeling through Adaptive Local Feature Decoupling"**. 
In this paper, we propose a method that is capable of modeling not only fine-scale motion but also large-scale motion effectively.

The source code and the processing scripts for the VRU dataset will be released by August at the latest.
