This repository is the official implementation of "LocalDyGS : Multi-view Global Dynamic Scene Modeling through Adaptive Local Feature Decoupling". 
In this paper, we propose a method that is capable of modeling not only fine-scale motion but also large-scale motion effectively.

The code will be released no later than August.
